It is a Javascript App which takes three input from user : Initial Stock Price, Quantity Bought/Held, Current Stock Price. And then calculates if the particular investment brought profit or loss for the investors. As an output it shows both absolute profit/loss amount and percentage values of the same. It also has two buttons named on profit and loss and buttons get lit automatically and changes it's color as per the output.

> While doing this project - I learn about Responsive CSS for the first time. I set the phone screen media at 900px and made changes accordingly. Initially I haven't planned to include a hero image, but I found good one, hence included. I also learned working with border-sizing and how to put elements side by side. Debugging this taught me few new things. I did the button color change through the JavaScript.
